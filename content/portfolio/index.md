## Projects

### RatTrace

RatTrace is the intelligent rat trap monitoring system which I developed for my
final year undergraduate engineering project. It works by measuring rat bait
levels and wirelessly reporting the results so that pest control experts don't
need to physically check each trap on location.

### 1000WAT website

[1000WAT](http://1000wat.com.au) is a Thai food restaurant based in Melbourne's
CBD. I created a new website for 1000WAT with a focus on responsive design and
simple content management. Ruby on Rails was used on the server-side, with
jQuery and Twitter Bootstrap providing a good client-side user experience.

### Self-balancing robot

This robot is able to balance itself on two wheels. The project involved
laying out a PCB using Altium Designer, soldering the manufactured circuit board,
and writing the embedded C code required to make it balance.

### Seed-dropping robot

The seed-dropping robot was created as an entrant for the 2014
[National Instruments Autonomous Robotics Commpetition](http://australia.ni.com/ni-arc).
This robot was able to navigate an obstacle course unassisted, using feedback
from a LiDAR and wheel encoders to determine an appropriate course.

This project was developed by a team of students from La Trobe University, and
was a finalist in the 2014 NI ARC competition.

### Home Guardian

Home Guardian is a home monitoring system designed for people who live alone and
are at an increased risk of falling victim to an injury or illness in and around
the home that would otherwise affect their ability to seek help on their own.

This project was developed by a team of students from La Trobe University,
and won 1st place in Telstra's inaugral M2M University Challenge in 2013.

### MediCom

MediCom is a real-time communication system designed for use in the medical
sector. It makes use of WebRTC for video conferencing capabilities and runs on
both mobile devices and PCs.

This project was developed by a team of students from La Trobe University
according to a brief from Ericsson Australia.
