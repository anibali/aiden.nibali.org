## Demo

You can find the demo site in action [here](https://shenoybr.github.io/hugo-goa-demo) and the source [here](https://github.com/shenoybr/hugo-goa-demo).

## Installation

From the root of your blog:

```
mkdir -p themes
cd themes
git clone https://github.com/shenoybr/hugo-goa 
```

## Content creation

### Creating a post

To create a new page or post:

````
hugo new about.md
````
or

````
hugo new posts/first.md
````

You can now go ahead an edit the newly created file under the `content` directory. Once you are finished editing, to have hugo generate the page, set `draft = false` in the articles front matter. 

### Organizing pages

The above example demonstrates how to create a pages and posts. Hugo automatically applies the list templates for a directory of pages/posts, which works well for blogs and posts. However, you may want at times want to override this behavior and create a standalone page (like an about page or projects page) or have more control of what content is listed from within the directory. In such cases, you can override the default behavior by placing an index.md file in the corresponding content
directory.

````
hugo new projects/index.md
````
